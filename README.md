# ToDoList

A simple .Net Core MVC web application that allows users to add tasks to their to-do list, view and edit details, and remove tasks from the list. Future plans are to:
- Add login system, allowing users to save their list
- Sort tasks not only by date, but also by priority
- Move completed tasks to the bottom of the list
- Deploy to Azure
